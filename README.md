#Steps for running this code

Ensure you have Python (version 3.9 or higher) and the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn) installed in your environment.

Download or clone the repository containing the assignment files.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (Python files) for each task to run the code step by step.

For Task 1, the dataset files should be placed in the appropriate directory or read from the specified URLs.

For Task 2 and Task 5, the code will generate visualizations, and the output will be displayed in the notebook.

For Task 4, different machine learning models will be implemented, and their performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics.

The Python code for each task includes comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each code block.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different parameters to gain deeper insights or improve the model performance.
